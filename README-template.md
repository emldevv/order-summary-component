## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process
I followed this general outline:
1. Boilerplates for html and CSS.
2. Structure html elements and items, adding classes and id's as much as I can before styling. Later I can edit classess and tags as they make more sense.
3. Start styling by building my custom properties menu. Then colours, fonts and styles in each section individually. I do this to preserve responsiveness as much as possible until I'm ready to position elements.
4. Positioning and sizing. When it comes to margins and padding, I tend to work top to bottom, rather than assigning each element more than one sizing property. For example, instead of all elements having a margin of 1em, the bottom of element a will have a margin bottom of 2em, element b and margin of 2 em, element c... so on and so forth. It makes it a lot easier to trouble shoot and edit.
5. Re-read style-guide and README for details on UI, and then add features.
6. Final touches.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The bigger lessons in this project were

BACKGROUND IMAGE
  replacing:
  ```css
  background-img {
    ...
  }

  with: 
  body {
      background-image: url(images/pattern-background-mobile.svg);
      background-size: 100%;
  }
  ```
  This solved a problem I was having with the background image not falling behind the card. Adding 'background-size: 100%' solved the image repeating.

ADJUSTING THE BACKGROUND IMAGE
The image was the 'mobile-first' version, and therefore repeated on the desktop. Whilst a desktop version of the image was provided, I was playing around with what happens if I switch to desktop mode with a smaller image.
a. Doesn't fill space laterally
b. I want it only half the height of the page
b. Repeats
This is how I fe=ixed each:
  ```css
  body {
    /* min-width: 375px; */
    background-image: url(images/pattern-background-mobile.svg);
    background-size: 100% 50%;      /* a and b solved */
    background-repeat: no-repeat;   /* c solved*/
  }
  ```

FITING AND IMAGE INSIDE A CONTAINER'S DIMENSIONS  
  The image at the top of the card had been giving me a lot of headaches. It was too wide, causing scrolling, and would not fit the shape of the card container. I solved this with two css properties:

  1. Image fit to container width
  ```css
  .hero img {
   max-width: 100%;
  }
  ```
  2. Image clipped to container shape/dimensions
  ```css
  .order-summary-card {
    overflow: hidden;
  }
  ```

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
